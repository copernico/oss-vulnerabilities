    text: While investigating UBSAN errors in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5365
        it was discovered Apache Arrow versions 0.12.0 to 0.14.1, left memory Array
        data uninitialized when reading RLE null data from parquet. This affected
        the C++, Python, Ruby and R implementations. The uninitialized memory could
        potentially be shared if are transmitted over the wire (for instance with
        Flight) or persisted in the streaming IPC and file formats.
