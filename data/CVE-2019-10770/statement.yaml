    text: All versions of io.ratpack:ratpack-core from 0.9.10 inclusive and before
        1.7.6 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). This affects the development
        mode error handler when an exception message contains untrusted data. Note
        the production mode error handler is not vulnerable - so for this to be utilized
        in production it would require users to not disable development mode.
