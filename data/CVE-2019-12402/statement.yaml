    text: The file name encoding algorithm used internally in Apache Commons Compress
        1.15 to 1.18 can get into an infinite loop when faced with specially crafted
        inputs. This can lead to a denial of service attack if an attacker can choose
        the file names inside of an archive created by Compress.
