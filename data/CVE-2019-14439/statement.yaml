    text: A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind
        2.x before 2.9.9.2. This occurs when Default Typing is enabled (either globally
        or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the
        service has the logback jar in the classpath.
