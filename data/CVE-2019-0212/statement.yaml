    text: In all previously released Apache HBase 2.x versions (2.0.0-2.0.4, 2.1.0-2.1.3),
        authorization was incorrectly applied to users of the HBase REST server. Requests
        sent to the HBase REST server were executed with the permissions of the REST
        server itself, not with the permissions of the end-user. This issue is only
        relevant when HBase is configured with Kerberos authentication, HBase authorization
        is enabled, and the REST server is configured with SPNEGO authentication.
        This issue does not extend beyond the HBase REST server.
